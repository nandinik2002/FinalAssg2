My code doesn’t work properly, and I think it’s mainly due to how I wrote the getNumberOfPredictions. I, however, think it is the right idea, but I may have not executed my approach correctly. The only data structure I had used besides the obvious DLB Trie, was the String Array, in both retrievePredictions and getNumberOfPredictions. I also used many pointers when traversing through the trie and size counters in a few methods I wrote. My algorithmic approach begins with a recursive helper method for the first method add(). Each character of the word is processed either navigating through existing nodes or creating new ones where needed. The methods advance() and retreat() are opposites which either add characters or remove the last character. The last 3 methods were very similar to implement as they traversed the same way while getNumberOfPredictions is simply calling the length of the last method. 


Asymptotic Analysis
- add(String word) method would be O(alphabet size) time, worst case being O(26). I believe my method’s run time would be based on the length of the word too, which would result in it being O(length of the word * alphabet size), because alphabet size also means the maximum number of children a node could have.
- advance(char c) method would be O(alphabet size) too and worst case being O(26). My method would be the same run time, O(alphabet size), because that is maximum how far the char would have to go to be added.
- retreat() method would be O(alphabet size) too and worst case being O(26). However, I believe my method runs in constant time O(1) because all we are doing is removing the last character of the word.
- reset() method would be O(1) even as worst case. My method would run in O(1) as well since all we are doing is setting currentPrefix to null.
- isWord() method would be O(1) worst case. However, my method became more complicated than that and I would say it is O(alphabet size * length of currentPrefix). We are checking each character in the current prefix to see if those whole word is a word present in the dictionary, and each character is maximum allowed to be 1/26 of the alphabet letters.
- add() method would be O(alphabet size * length of the running prefix). I believe my method works in O(1) time because all it is doing is calling another method I had written (add) to add this certain word into the dictionary if it isn’t already in the dictionary.  
- getNumberOfPredictions() method would work in O(1) time, which is how my method works as well. I am simply calling the size of the ArrayList from retrievePredictions().
- retrievePrediction() method would work in O(length of the returned word). My method would work in the same runtime. This is because we use a pointer to traverse through the trie searching for only 1 word with the current prefix.
- retrievePredictions() method would be O(length of the returned words), and so would the method I wrote, because it has a similar approach to the above retrieveprediction method, but including ALL of the words with that prefix.

Does your program run without errors?: No

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your
program run correctly?:

I wasnt able to get any of the methods to work correctly with the test cases, however, I believe I have written the methods using a somewhat correct logic.
